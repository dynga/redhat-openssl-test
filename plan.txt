=== TEST PLAN ===

Scope:

This test plan aims to test whether TLS connections estabilished by OpenSSL respect the profile set by 'crypto-policies'.

This test plan targets Fedora 41 and focuses only on 'DEFAULT' and 'LEGACY' profiles of 'crypto-policies'.

Test Scenarios:

1. Verify that the required Diffie-Hellman parameter length is getting adjusted correctly between profiles
    - LEGACY accepts Diffie-Hellman parameters >= 1024 bits in size, while DEFAULT accepts only >= 2048 bits

    Test cases:
        - set policy to LEGACY, try connecting with DH parameters 1023b long -> connection should fail
        - set policy to LEGACY, try connecting with DH parameters 1024b long -> connection should succeed
        - set policy to DEFAULT, try connecting with DH parameters 2047b long -> connection should fail
        - set policy to DEFAULT, try connecting with DH parameters 2048b long -> connection should succeed

2. Verify that signature algorithms get correctly adjusted between profiles
    - LEGACY accepts signature algorithms encrypted with SHA-1 or better and accepts DSA, DEFAULT accepts SHA-224 encryption or better and doesn't accept DSA

    Test cases:
        - set policy to DEFAULT, try connecting with DSA -> connection should fail
        - set policy to DEFAULT, try connecting with (RSA / ECDSA) -> connection should succeed
        - set policy to LEGACY, try connecting with an RSA key encrypted with SHA-0 -> connection should fail
        - set policy to LEGACY, try connecting with an RSA key encrypted with SHA-1 -> connection should succeed
        - set policy to DEFAULT, try connecting with an RSA key encrypted with SHA-1 -> connection should fail
        - set policy to DEFAULT, try connecting with an RSA key encrypted with SHA-224 -> connection should succeed

3. Verify that the set of accepted TLS ciphers changes correctly between profiles
    - LEGACY accepts the 3DES TLS cipher while DEFAULT doesn't

    Test cases:
        - set policy to DEFAULT, try connecting with the 3DES TLS cipher -> connection should fail
        - set policy to DEFAULT, try connecting with (AES / ChaCha20) -> connection should succeed

4. Verify that the RSA key size is getting adjusted correctly between profiles
    - LEGACY accepts RSA keys >= 1024 bits in size, but DEFAULT accepts only >= 2048 bits

    Test cases:
        - set policy to LEGACY, try connecting with an RSA key 1023b long -> connection should fail
        - set policy to LEGACY, try connecting with an RSA key 1024b long -> connection should succeed
        - set policy to DEFAULT, try connecting with an RSA key 2047b long -> connection should fail
        - set policy to DEFAULT, try connecting with an RSA key 2048b long -> connection should succeed

5. Verify that the allowed TLS protocol versions are getting adjusted correctly between versions
    - LEGACY accepts TLS >= 1.0, DEFAULT only >= 1.2

        Testing:
        - set policy to DEFAULT, try connecting with TLS 1.1 -> connection should fail
        - set policy to DEFAULT, try connecting with TLS 1.2 -> connection should succeed
